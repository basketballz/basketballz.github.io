<p style="font-size:250%;">Why He Got Game is my favorite movie?.</p>





<p style="font-size:100%;">He Got Game by Spike Lee is my favorite movie because it combines my favorite passions and struggles. Jesus (ray allen) has struggled from poverty and the struggles of not having a mom.</p>





<p style=" font-size:250%;"> Why Denzel Washington is the greatest actor ever?</p>




 <p style=" font-size:100%;">Denzel Washington is mainly my favorite actor because he did a great job working with spike lee to make this movie but his work ethic really surprised me. </p>
