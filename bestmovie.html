<P> WHY 'HE GOT GAME' IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE?

</P>



<P> He Got Game by Spike Lee is my favorite movie because it combines my favorite passions and struggles. Jesus (ray allen) has struggled from poverty and the struggles of not having a mom.

<p> WHY DENZEL WASHINGTON IS MY FAVORITE ACTOR?

</P>


<p> Denzel Washington is mainly my favorite actor because he did a great job working with spike lee to make this movie but his work ethic really surprised me.
